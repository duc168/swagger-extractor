# Swagger Extractor

You want  to extract the data from Swagger (API information) but you do not own the swagger, or may you just want to get the API data quickly without needing to access the codebase
**So this is exactly what you need to do it.**

### Usage:
1. Copy the content of ``init.js`` and paste it into your Swagger browser console.
2. Run it, you will have all the endpoints opened out, ready for next step
3. Copy the content of ``main.js`` and paste it into the console
4. You will see a json text, copy it and use it as you want. Happy Hacking!

###### _Notice_: 
_This is just a script, it is still in experiment, so it will not work all the times. 
If you experienced the failed case, please let me know, i will try to fix it as soon as possible._
